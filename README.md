# TeamHGSApi
An API created to compare strings within Marketo via a Webhook implementation.

This is a very simple API created to solve a very simple problem. We have two fields within Marketo that we needed to compare values. Marketo is currently unable to perform this function so this API was created to resolve that lack of functionality.

The API is accessed from within Marketo using a Webhook.

Swagger has been included for easy reference and testing of the API.
